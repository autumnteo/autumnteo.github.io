This project is my own personal website which was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
The project was styled used [Tailwind framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).

The website is hosted using [github pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

This project was mainly to familiarise myself with React and HTML/CSS\
